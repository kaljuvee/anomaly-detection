# 🚀 Streamlit.io Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account with access to the repository
- Streamlit Community Cloud account (free at https://streamlit.io/cloud)

### Step-by-Step Deployment

#### 1. Access Streamlit Community Cloud
- Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
- Sign in with your GitHub account

#### 2. Deploy New App
- Click "New app" or "Deploy an app"
- Select your GitHub repository: `kaljuvee/anomaly-detection`
- Set the main file path: `Home.py`
- Choose branch: `main`

#### 3. Configuration
The app will automatically detect and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
```
streamlit>=1.47.0
pycaret>=3.3.0
plotly>=5.24.0
pandas>=2.1.0
numpy>=1.26.0
scikit-learn>=1.4.0
scipy>=1.11.0
seaborn>=0.13.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0
openpyxl>=3.1.0
```

#### 4. Advanced Settings (Optional)
- **App URL**: Choose a custom subdomain (e.g., `anomaly-detection-demo`)
- **Python version**: 3.11 (default)
- **Secrets**: None required for this app

#### 5. Deploy
- Click "Deploy!" 
- Wait for the build process (typically 2-5 minutes)
- Your app will be available at: `https://[your-app-name].streamlit.app/`

### Expected Build Time
- **Initial deployment**: 3-5 minutes
- **Subsequent updates**: 1-2 minutes

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails due to dependencies**: 
   - Ensure all packages in requirements.txt are compatible
   - PyCaret may take longer to install (this is normal)

2. **Memory issues**:
   - Streamlit Community Cloud has memory limits
   - The app is optimized to work within these constraints

3. **File upload limits**:
   - Streamlit.io has file upload size limits (typically 200MB)
   - This is already configured in the app

### App Features Ready for Streamlit.io
✅ **Multi-page architecture** with proper navigation
✅ **Optimized dependencies** for cloud deployment  
✅ **Memory-efficient** data processing
✅ **Error handling** for edge cases
✅ **Professional UI/UX** with responsive design
✅ **File upload constraints** within platform limits

### Post-Deployment
Once deployed, your app will:
- Auto-update when you push changes to the main branch
- Be accessible 24/7 at your Streamlit.io URL
- Handle multiple concurrent users
- Provide real-time anomaly detection capabilities

### Monitoring and Updates
- **Logs**: Available in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- **Analytics**: Basic usage statistics provided
- **Updates**: Automatic deployment on GitHub push
- **Scaling**: Handled automatically by Streamlit
